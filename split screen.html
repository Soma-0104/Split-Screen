      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>HTML</h3>
      <p id="ht">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup 
        language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render
        the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page 
        semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and 
        other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
        HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text 
        such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are
        delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags directly 
        introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide 
        information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

      </p>
      <h3>CSS</h3>
      <p id="cs">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
        fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility 
        and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
        which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css 
        file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    </p>
      <h3>JS</h3>  
      <p id="js">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, 
        is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
        alongside HTML and CSS.
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
        It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for 
        working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, 
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).
